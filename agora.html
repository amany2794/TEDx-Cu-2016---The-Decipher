Hailed as the first birthplace of path-breaking ideas, Agora was a place of gathering for people of all interests and ranks to display their talents, share their thoughts, and unite their voices with one another. At the heart of ancient greek city-states, citizens met to make history.
This year, we decided to revive the Agorian model to bring forth the brilliant minds of our time.
Just as the Greeks decided to give an opportunity for everyone to share what’s on their minds along with what’s in their caravans, so will we recreate an eventful conference for you all to nurture your faith in humanity’s progress.
We hereby invite you to become an Agorian for a day. Pack your bags, load up your caravans and fill the application to initiate your journey to our modern Agora!
Join our modern Agora on April 29th for a day resplendent with mind-provoking talks, entertaining performances and sweet discoveries that are sure to lodge in your mind.

                <p class="bio" > 

At the age of forty, Iman Refaat decided to chase her long lost dream of writing a novel. Iman wanted her book to be a wake-up call for humanity.Having been an educator for decades, she observed how little motivated youngsters are, yet believed in their potential, the one she dreams to unleash, and that lead her to be a life coach, trainer, and public speaker, and blogger.  Iman believes that we make the meanings, we make the definitions, but we aren’t aware of that. Yet, once we gain awareness, we will stop allowing social norms, culture and traditions to lead us, blind-folded.

Yasmine has a singular background. After studying the Arts of the English Language, at the age of 22, she managed to get labeled the youngest female to work in the diplomatic quarter.
Influenced by her admiration of psychology, she believes that changing one aspect of society, let alone the entire world, is a process that starts with ourselves. She regards human nature as always seeking perfection. One of her favorite movies is Al Akhlaq Al Hamida, which tells the story of a merchant selling personality traits and qualities, priceless goods much needed in society. in John Lennon’s Imagine, he dreamt of a world of peace. Yasmine genuinely wishes to see people more tolerant and honest and less judgmental and hypocritical

                <p class="bio" >Leena’s goal in life is to leave a print in the society, as much as it sounds cheesy, “if not now, when? If not me, who?” she have lived with this quote for the past 3years and it controlled a lot of beautiful decisions in her life.
During her teen age, Leena has had ups and downs with her family and friends. Her relationship with her mother was very complicated, her ways of communication always made things get worse.
                    She ought to change the ways of communication with her loved-ones; by knowing them, by treating them the way they deserve to be treated. Appreciation and a sprinkle of love could have cured it all. And this is what she will be talking about; the types of sprinkles of love used to make the communication a little sweeter.Hopefully using out our funny, relatable, daily Egyptian situations and arguments would help her introduce the different pixie sprinkles of love we all need to maintain our lifetime bonds with our beloved ones.</p></div>

Khafagy's aren't really a band.they are brother and sister who had a very long journey to reach us today. Muhammad was a professional swimmer that has nothing to do with music. It all began with their mother's wish to be an oud player, and here both of them decided to learn
oud. Fortunately, Muhammad was too talented that he found his way of escape in his playing, and it became his only source of utter joy and happiness. But for Sara, she found herself in singing. Her voice was her weapon against the ugliness of our realities. And out of their chemistry together, they found themselves a team. A team that can never be separated.
Muhammad is 22 years old. He attends electrical engineering in the Faculty of Engineering in Cairo University. And Sara is 20 years old that also went after her brother and attends architectural engineering in Cairo University.
